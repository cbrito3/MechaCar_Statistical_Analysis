## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
Based on the output from the linear regression and the summary of the model (as seen in the pictures), we can address the following questions:

Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?

Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?

Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
